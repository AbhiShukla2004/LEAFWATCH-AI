# Training Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook used for training machine learning models using TensorFlow and Keras. It demonstrates data preprocessing, model architecture design, training procedures, and visualization techniques with Matplotlib.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `training.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all code, data preprocessing steps, model creation, training, and evaluation.

## ðŸ›  Key Features

- Data preprocessing using TensorFlow's image processing layers like `Rescaling`, `Resizing`, `RandomFlip`, `RandomRotation`, and `RandomContrast`.
- Model building using `Sequential` API from Keras.
- Visualization of training metrics using Matplotlib.
- Implementation with TensorFlow's efficient backend for deep learning.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

The project requires Python 3 and the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras (integrated within TensorFlow)
- Matplotlib

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
2. Install the dependencies:
 pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
4. Open training.ipynb and run the cells to train and visualize the model.

ðŸ“„ Notes

Ensure you have the proper Python version (Python 3.8 or higher recommended).

GPU acceleration is recommended for faster training, but CPU execution is also supported.

This notebook can be adapted for various datasets and architectures.
